## UUID Generation for Test Data

When converting Postman collections to Playwright tests, you'll often need unique Shopware-compatible IDs for rules, flows, and conditions. Since AI assistants cannot generate truly unique UUIDs, use the provided UUID generator script.

### UUID Generator Script

**Location**: search project for package.json with script called "uuid:generate"

**Purpose**: Generates Shopware-compatible UUIDs (32-character hex strings without hyphens) for use in Playwright tests.

**Usage**:
```bash
cd tests
# Generate default 15 UUIDs
pnpm run uuid:generate

# Generate specific number of UUIDs
pnpm run uuid:generate -- -n 20

# Direct script execution
node .cursor/uuid-generator.js -n 10
```

**When to Use**:
- Creating new Playwright test files from Postman collections
- Need unique IDs for rules, flows, conditions, or other entities
- Want to ensure test data isolation
- Converting tests that require static, predictable IDs

**Example Output**:
```
Generating 15 Shopware-compatible UUIDs:

1. 0198b4274dd476f288a8d00d59579e79
2. 0198bed341ba7c249f097546d9800f12
3. 0198becd251a728b84f5397b19b04f3c

```
