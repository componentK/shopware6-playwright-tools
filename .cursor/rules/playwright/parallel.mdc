- ensure that tests are isolated from each other
- use static UUIDs that are unique when creating entities
- do not re-use UUID's across different tests unless the tests are intentionally linked
- you can re-use UUID's for global `system_config` entries as you do not want multiple to exist in the DB table
- when testing Flow's, make sure the create unique rules (e.g. customer last name, cart product quantity)
